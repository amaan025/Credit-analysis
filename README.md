• Built an end-to-end credit risk scoring pipeline in Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn) including EDA, missing-value analysis, outlier detection, feature preprocessing, and comparison of multiple imputation strategies using ROC-AUC as the evaluation metric.

• Addressed class imbalance with upsampling and undersampling, trained and compared Logistic Regression and SVM models, performed threshold tuning, cross-validation, and GridSearchCV hyperparameter optimization to improve recall, F1-score, and decision performance for high-risk (BAD) borrowers.
